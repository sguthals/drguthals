# Hi there 👋

My name is Sarah!

🔭 I’m currently working on content for folks to learn about data science, machine learning, and other various coding topics!

🌱 I’m currently focusing on technical topics that you might not have learned in school such as git and GitHub. Find my [playlist here](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/WYDLIS_Videos).

🎮 Soon I will be focuing on video game developement. Find my [playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjoGSbuzyEri7kBQ1A7llaToqlXMfEydz).
